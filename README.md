# Swiss-style Tournament
This project models the players and matches needed for a Swiss-style tournament.

# Setup
This app requires a Postgres setup.

1. Run `psql`
2. `\i tournament.sql` to create the database and tables.
3. Run `tournament_test.py` to run unit tests. This gives a good demonstration on how to use the API in `tournament.py`
